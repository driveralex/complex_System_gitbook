# Introduction

This document is the result of a school project at ESISAR. It is based on practicals on the course of complex systems by Laurent Lef√®vre and Pierre-Alain Toupance.

This is an introcution to the study of graphs as a modelisation of large and complex systems.

First we will get used of basics network concept as well as the tools used \( R language and Igraph package\).

Then we will focus on the genration of random graph.

Then we will use 2  practical case with the voter model and epidemic model as exemple on how we can create a modelisation, run simulation on it, and extract useful informations from the results.

Finnaly we will see how we can go furthers using real data inputs, and more a detailed simulation.
