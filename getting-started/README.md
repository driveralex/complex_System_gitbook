# Getting Started

The aim of the getting started section is to rise in competence with graph representations, metrics and the R software.

To facilitate the practical study of graphs we will use the R language. R is commonly used for data processing and statistical analysis. We will also use the Igraph R library which is dedicated in the creation, manipulation and analysis of graph networks.

Both R and Igraph are distributed under the GNU GPL v2 license.
